# Java-Data-Structures and Algorithms 🚀

## Overview 📝

Welcome to the **Java-Data-Structures and Algorithms** repository! This project is part of my journey to master Data Structures and Algorithms, following the course by [Kunal Kushwaha](https://www.youtube.com/c/KunalKushwaha) and solving problems from Leetcode.

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Java. The goal is to deepen understanding and improve problem-solving skills by tackling real-world problems.

## Assignments 📝

In the Assignments folder, you will find a collection of Leetcode problems that I am working on as part of the course assignments. Each problem includes the following:

- Problem description
- Approach and solution
- Java code implementation
